# Korona-Info 🦠🇲🇪
This is an open source website for tracking the  COVID-19 epidemic in **Montenegro**. The data comes from a mixed set of sources including the official stats from the Institute of Public Health of Montenegro (IJZCG).

I built this project in my free time. Contributions 🤗 are welcome!
Follow me on Twitter if you want to hear me complain [@luangjokaj](https://twitter.com/luangjokaj) or checkout my [work](https://www.riangle.com/) if you care.
